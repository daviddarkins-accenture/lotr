In the last post, We showed how to ingest a Lord of the Rings API into Data 360. https://lnkd.in/euqnm3VQ

The data landed successfully in Data 360. But here's where the real journey begins.

The Lord of the Rings API gives two fundamentally different things:

**Characters** - identity eg your Salesforce CRM Person Account data

**Quotes** - activity eg data related to that Salesforce CRM Person Account

Treat them correctly, and something powerful happens.

Such as taking Agentforce to the next level because you have brought in your external data to ground your Agents with data beyond CRM.

This is the difference between a data lake and a unified customer view.

And it all comes down to how you model Profile vs Engagement data and use it effectively in places like Agentforce and Automation.

I break this down in Part 2 of the series:
