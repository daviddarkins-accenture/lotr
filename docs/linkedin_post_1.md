## Post Content

One question keeps coming up whenever I talk about consuming data in Data 360:

"Can Data Cloud / Data 360 consume this API? There's no connector for it."

These APIs are often a cornerstone of an organisation's data strategy. They've been around for years. They speak HTTPS, return JSON and when they were built, Salesforce connectors weren't exactly top of mind.

Waiting for "one connector to rule them all" isn't a strategy. It's sometimes wishful thinking.

There are so many ways to do this, but I wanted to explore the Salesforce Data 360 Ingestion API - it's not discussed enough, and I wanted to prove that if you speak its language, you shall pass. (lots of Lord Of The Rings references to come, buckle up)

I took a fun Lord of the Rings API - the furthest thing from your traditional enterprise API, and very much had no Salesforce Data 360 connector. An unexpected journey into Middle-earth data.

Follow along as I take Middle-earth data from a random API all the way into Salesforce CRM - unified profiles, automation, and Agentforce-ready.
