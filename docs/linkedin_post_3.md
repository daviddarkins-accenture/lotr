In Parts 1 and 2, we journeyed from the Shire to the Misty Mountains, ingesting a Lord of the Rings API into Data 360 and forging the two towers of data — Profiles and Engagements. https://lnkd.in/ecBsxAEf

But here's where the real magic happens.

The data has returned. And it's not just sitting in Data 360 — it's become first-class in Salesforce CRM.

Treebeard's character data now lives as a Person Account. His 45 quotes appear as a Related List on his Account page. And when you ask Agentforce "Did Treebeard ever talk about Gandalf?" — the agent queries across both CRM data and all 45 quotes from Data 360.

This isn't just integration. It's transformation.

But here's the real hook: The same pattern that worked for LOTR characters works for:

🏥 **Healthcare** — Patient data from EMRs → Person Accounts → Lab results as Related Lists → Agents answer medication questions

🛒 **Retail** — Customer data from loyalty platforms → Unified profiles → Transaction history as Related Lists → Agents answer purchase questions

🏭 **Manufacturing** — Device data from IoT → Asset records → Sensor readings as Related Lists → Agents answer alert questions

💳 **Financial Services** — Account data from banking systems → CRM Accounts → Transaction history as Related Lists → Agents answer transaction questions

The architecture is identical. The only difference is the domain.

If a fan-made fantasy API can become first-class in Salesforce, your enterprise data can too.
