In Parts 1 and 2, we journeyed from the Shire to the Misty Mountains, ingesting a Lord of the Rings API into Data 360 and forging the two towers of data — Profiles and Engagements.

But data in Data 360 alone isn't the destination. The real magic happens when external data becomes first-class in Salesforce CRM.

Here's what happens when Data 360 meets CRM:

🔗 **Identity Resolution** — Data 360 unifies Treebeard's profile with a Salesforce Person Account using `characterId`

⚡ **Salesforce Flows** — When a new character lands in Data 360, a Flow automatically creates a Person Account in CRM

📋 **Related Lists** — Treebeard's 45 quotes appear directly on his Account page, powered by Data 360 Engagement data

🤖 **Agentforce** — AI agents can now query across both CRM data and external data in a single, unified profile

This isn't just integration. It's transformation.

External data becomes as native to Salesforce as any standard object. Users see it in the UI. Flows trigger on it. Agents reason over it.

The journey from random API to first-class CRM data is complete.
