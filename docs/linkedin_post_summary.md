The fellowship is complete. The journey from external API to first-class CRM data is done.

Over three articles, we took a fan-made Lord of the Rings API (933 characters, 2,383 quotes) and made it first-class in Salesforce — no connector, no middleware, just the Ingestion API.

Here's what we built:

**Part 1: From the Shire to the Misty Mountains**
We ingested the LOTR API into Data 360 using the native Ingestion API. Two-step token exchange. OpenAPI 3.0 schemas. Batch ingestion. The data landed.

**Part 2: The Two Towers**
We forged Profiles (stable identity) and Engagements (high-volume activity). We learned why the distinction matters — not just for data modeling, but as the foundation for trustworthy AI.

**Part 3: The Return of the Data**
We bridged Data 360 to CRM. Identity Resolution linked external profiles to Person Accounts. Salesforce Flows automated record creation. Related Lists surfaced engagement data. Agentforce queried unified profiles.

The result? External data became as native to Salesforce as any standard object.

But here's the real value: The same pattern works for healthcare (patient data from EMRs), retail (customer data from loyalty platforms), manufacturing (device data from IoT), and financial services (account data from banking systems).

The architecture is identical. The only difference is the domain.

If a fantasy API can become first-class in Salesforce, your enterprise data can too.
